								Before the site implementation was first begun near the end of the summer of 2019, the idea came from a certain source of inspiration. The details are fuzzy and all the sentences following are more or less stream of consciousness, but that is all that is required for now since this is just placeholder text. After time and some changes the idea was further solidifed and was eventually crystallized to the point of realization. About here the paragraph should be long enough to flow past the first image associated with it. Now I'll continue to the next example paragraph, with its own photo, floated right.

								I needed a second paragraph to better show how a taller image could behave.
